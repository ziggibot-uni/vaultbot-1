    Per-connection conversation history lives on the websocket; the
    sliding window bounds it when it grows too long. The receive loop
    spawns fire-and-forget tasks for each chat/research turn so stop/new
    messages stay responsive.

    SESSION RESUME (2026-08-15): The frontend sends the last-known
    ``session_id`` as a query parameter (``?sid=<uuid>``) so a dropped-
    and-reconnected socket resumes the SAME session instead of minting a
    fresh UUID with zero history. When no ``sid`` is provided (first-ever
    connect, or an older plugin build), the backend falls back to the
    last-active-session pointer written on every turn. Only when that is
    absent too does it mint a new UUID. This fixes the "cuts out and
    resumes the wrong session" bug.

    AUTO-RESUME: If RESTART_CONTEXT.md exists (written by backend_restart
    before triggering a restart), the agent proactively sends a message to
    the operator and spawns handle_chat with a synthetic "continue" trigger. This
    means after a restart, the agent wakes up and continues working without
    the operator having to send a wake-up message. See [[Auto-Resume-Directive]].
