"""Services registry — bundles all VaultBot backend singletons.

main.py is a service-locator monolith: ~25 module-level singletons
(ollama_client, vault_indexer, vault_graph, fused_retriever, amem, ...)
constructed at startup, then referenced as free variables by helper
functions and route handlers. As main.py is split into separate modules
(chat_handler.py, weaving.py, task_api.py, ...), those extracted functions
can no longer read the globals as free variables. Instead they receive a
`Services` instance as a parameter and access singletons via `svc.<name>`.

Phase 3 (typed Services): the fields are now typed with their real classes
(imported under ``TYPE_CHECKING`` so no runtime import cycle is created).
This gives IDE autocomplete + type-checking across every extracted module
without changing the no-cycle property.  ``get_services()`` / ``set_services()``
live in ``app_state.py`` and are the FastAPI dependency-injection surface.

class Services:
    """Bundle of all VaultBot backend singletons.

    Constructed once in main.py after the globals block. Extracted modules
    receive a `Services` instance as their first parameter and access
    singletons via attribute access (``svc.ollama_client``, etc.) instead of
    reading main.py's module-level globals as free variables.  Routers
    receive it via ``Depends(get_services)`` (see app_state.py).

    The ``ollama_client``, ``vision_client``, and ``small_client`` fields are
    mutable: the ``/llm/config`` / ``/llm/vision_config`` / ``/llm/small_config``
    routes can swap the corresponding client at runtime, and every
    ``Depends(get_services)`` consumer sees the new client immediately
    (the dataclass instance is shared, not re-created per request).
