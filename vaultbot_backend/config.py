"""Typed tunables — one source of truth for magic constants.

Every hard-coded threshold/limit/size that was previously a module-level
constant scattered across chat_handler, self_improver, context_budgeter,
identity, small_model_filters, and session_logger lives here now. The
``TUNABLES`` singleton is a frozen dataclass: type-safe, IDE-autocompletable,
and impossible to mutate at runtime.

Env overrides stay where they are (``os.environ.get(...)`` at construction
sites). Only the *default* values move here, so there's one place to see and
tune every knob. Behavior is unchanged — this is a pure relocation refactor.

Why a frozen dataclass (not a dict / not module globals):
  - Type-checked: each ``TUNABLES.<field>`` is a concrete type to the type
    checker, not ``Any``.
  - Autocompletable: the IDE lists every tunable the moment you type
    ``TUNABLES.``.
  - Immutable: ``frozen=True`` prevents accidental reassignment from
    a hot path.
  - Importable: every module imports the same singleton, so there's no
    risk of two modules drifting on the "same" constant.

If you need a runtime override for a value here, keep the existing
``os.environ.get(NAME, str(TUNABLES.x))`` pattern so the default is
discoverable from this file.

    # task. This runs EVERY round and stubs tool results older than N rounds

    # window size, we never send more than this.
    #
    # History: originally 60K to prevent "2000 t/s but still slow" on local
    # models where 100K+ token prompts made each round sluggish. But that
    # cap was catastrophic for cloud models with 1M context windows: the
    # model was actively working through a complex multi-round task (64
    # tool rounds, making real progress) and the cap kept pruning away
    # context the model needed — old tool results, prior reasoning, file
    # contents — causing it to lose the plot and go in circles. The cap
    # was 16x smaller than the model's actual context window.
    #
    # 800K leaves ~200K for the model's output (thinking + content + tool
    # calls) within a 1M context window. For local models with smaller
    # context (e.g. 32K), the cap still applies as a hard ceiling — the
    # pruning logic in enforce_token_cap activates when total tokens exceed
    # this number, regardless of model context size.

    # no truncation except for extremely long files that would actually hurt

    # vault notes, source files, and textbook sections pass through intact,
