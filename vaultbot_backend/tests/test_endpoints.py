"""Endpoint tests via FastAPI TestClient — verifies the main.py shims wire correctly.

This test file is EXEMPT from the conftest guard that forbids `import main`.
It sets `__allows_main_import__ = True` at module level and uses
VAULTBOT_SKIP_LOCK=1 to bypass the PID lock. The lifespan context manager
(added in commit 92958698) means `import main` doesn't fire startup/shutdown
on bare import — only TestClient(app) or uvicorn.run triggers them.

The tests use TestClient(app) to hit the HTTP routes in-process. The
route handlers read module-level globals (ollama_client, vault_indexer,
etc.) which are constructed at import time — so the real services are
wired, not fakes. This means /health hits _ping_ollama() (which may fail
if Ollama isn't running — that's fine, the test checks structure not
dependency status) and /models hits ollama_client.list_local_models()
(which returns [] if Ollama is down — also fine).

Documentation grounding:
- FastAPI Testing Events: `with TestClient(app) as client:` fires the
  lifespan (startup + shutdown). https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/testing-events/
- FastAPI Testing Dependencies: `app.dependency_overrides` for faking.

    """Create a TestClient WITHOUT firing the lifespan.

    We use `TestClient(app)` directly (not `with TestClient(app) as c:`)
    so the lifespan startup/shutdown DON'T fire — the startup tries to
    load the real FAISS index and start the file watcher, which hangs
    when a real backend is already running. The route handlers read
    module-level globals that are already
    already constructed at import time, so the routes work without
    the lifespan having run.

    This is safe because:
    - `VAULTBOT_SKIP_LOCK=1` bypasses the PID lock (set at module top).
    - The route handlers read globals (ollama_client, vault_indexer,
      etc.) that are constructed at `import main` time, not at lifespan
      startup time. The lifespan startup only loads the FAISS INDEX
      + starts the watcher + researcher — the *objects* already exist.
    - /health calls _ping_ollama() which may fail (Ollama not running)
      — that's fine, the test checks structure not dependency status.
