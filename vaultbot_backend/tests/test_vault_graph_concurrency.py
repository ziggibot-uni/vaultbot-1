"""Tests for vault_graph concurrency — thread safety of the RLock guard.

The file watcher / background refresh thread calls refresh() while the chat
loop reads nodes/edges/backlinks via dangling_links(), thin_notes(),
neighbors(), etc.  Without a lock this raises
``RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration``.

These tests hammer refresh() in one thread while reading from another,
asserting no RuntimeError for thousands of iterations.
