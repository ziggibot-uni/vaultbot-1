"""Contract tests for the Services registry: every attribute the
extracted modules (chat_handler, routers) read off ``svc`` must actually
exist on the ``Services`` dataclass. These catch the class of bug where
a consumer references ``svc.vault_path`` (or any other attribute) before
the API is defined on the registry.

Bug caught: 2026-07-30, ``chat_handler.py`` did ``svc.vault_path`` in
the post-chat vault-change broadcast, but ``Services`` had no such
field — the broadcast crashed with
``'Services' object has no attribute 'vault_path'`` on every turn.

These tests construct a ``Services`` with stub singletons (no main
import, no real indexer) and assert the attributes the consumers use
are present and well-typed.
