"""Agentic chat loop -- Copilot-style, simple.

The model drives. It can use plan_task / update_task to track its own state
(the harness re-injects the working-memory block every round so the model
always sees its todo list). The framework enforces ONE rule: if the model
works 3+ tool rounds without a plan, execution tools are masked until it
calls plan_task. No phase state machine, no auto-advance, no forced
convergence, no consolidation, no step summaries -- just the one-rule plan
gate plus the read-loop detector that observes actual tool results.

What we keep:
- _sanitize_tool_history: convert tool-call rounds to model-safe format
- double-silent failsafe: if the model emits nothing twice, fail loud
- checkpointing: save progress so a crash resumes mid-turn
- answer streaming: answer_chunk / answer_done / thinking events
- per-step RAG: retrieve notes relevant to the current in-progress step
- tool dispatch: execute_agent_tool unchanged (plan_task / update_task /
  custom tools / code tools / etc.)

2026-08-13: removed Hermes-style preflight compression -- the small-model
summarization latency cost outweighed the token savings. The hard token cap
(_enforce_token_cap) and proactive tool-result aging (_age_old_tool_results)
remain as the primary context-bounding mechanisms.
